# Hand3dRHD
This repository contains the video results for a convolutional neural network for 3D hand pose estimation from 2D key points in RGB images. Coding in Python (PyTorch and TensorFlow).

Reference: Benchmarked the model’s performance metrics (Confusion Matrix, Accuracy) with the results of the research paper Zimmermann, Christian, “Learning to estimate 3d hand pose from single RGB images, 2017”.
